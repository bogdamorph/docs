# Welcome to Bogdamorph

Bogdamorph is a token that primarily gives you rewards in BOG; we also have a P2E game currently in development and the creation of a private investment DAO for future $BDM holders.

We are a young and dynamic group of individuals with a passion for sci-fi and an “everything crypto” mentality, It’s previously been said before most investors are terrible at spotting exponential growth, so they don’t value potentially high-growth coins correctly; We consider it part of our mission to educate newcomers so they won’t have to pay the price we paid to learn.

Thus, we merged our immense interest and created the coin Bogdamorph ($BDM). Our community is designed as a safe space to discuss safe projects, get and give honest and constructive feedback, and ask hard questions to ensure you know what we are investing in!



### Why and what is $BDM?

Why, you ask? Who can spice up a project more than the incredible Bogdanoff twins and their beautiful alien-shaped skulls?

If you are looking for a caring and hard-working team to give your trust to, we are your people; It’s all been fun and games so far, but it doesn’t end there. We eventually hope to vet projects and have a private DAO for our holders, Bringing even more gains! How can one distinguish between legitimate projects and landmines? Join the Bogdamorphs now to find out.

By holding Bogdamorph, you will receive Bogged finance’s native coin, $BOG. In the past, Bogdanofs had manipulated its price, and They had destroyed the coin. Having just relaunched, its potential is greater than ever. The reward function will pay out automatically at 5k BOG holdings to save on gas and have a manual claim option.

The Contracts Liquidity Function will add a percentage of each transaction (buys and sells) to Bogdamorph’s liquidity pool. We pride ourselves on having significant liquidity, so purposely, the figure is 10%.  At its core, liquidity reflects the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. Thus, the more liquid crypto is, the less volatile and more stable the coin is through buys and sells. Having this will also help larger transactions occur in the future and keep the functions working smoothly.
